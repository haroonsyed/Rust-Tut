Rust files end with extension '.rs'
You must install the rust runtime, it does not run natively
To compile a rust file use "rustc file.rs", which will create an executable

Starting a project:
Use the cargo package manager
"cargo init"
This will create a cargo.toml file which has all the dependencies and config

Running a project:
Execute "cargo run", which will compile and run the code in src
The compiled files will be located in a target folder, which should be git ignored
