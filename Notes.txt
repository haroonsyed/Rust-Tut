Rust files end with extension '.rs'
You must install the rust runtime, it does not run natively
To compile a rust file use "rustc file.rs", which will create an executable

Starting a project:
Use the cargo package manager
"cargo init"
This will create a cargo.toml file which has all the dependencies and config

Running a project:
Execute "cargo run", which will compile and run the code in src
The compiled files will be located in a target folder, which should be git ignored

Compiling for production:
Execute "cargo build --release". This will include optimizations.
The release folder in target will contain the executable.

FUNCTIONS:
Create a function with "pub fn name(){}"
First import said file in another file with "mod filename;"
Call said function with "filename::func()"

STRING/PRINT:
"{}" is a placeholder for a variable or non-string type or arg name.
println!("My age is {}",20);
Putting an index in "{}" indicates which argument to use.
println!("My name is {1} my age is{0}",20,"Haroon");

VARIABLES:
defined with "let age = 20"
Variables are block scoped and IMMUTABLE by default
to make mutable define as "let mut age = 20"
To define a constant (inlined), the type must also be specified "const ID:i32 =52"
